# Desktop Files
Launchers for useful stuff

## rdesktop

Dummy launcher mostly to give the windows vm a nice icon once it's launched.

## tmux

Launch Gnome Terminal with tmux running in it. Will attach to an existing session if available

## Windows VM

For launching a particular rdesktop session. Tweak settings are you see fit.
